~Amber Kinetics Inc UI/UX Engineer Assessment~

Description:

Welcome to Amber Kinetics Inc's UI/UX assessment challenge. We hope you find this assessment interesting, and maybe even fun!

The app is a single-page application with dynamic content. The screen consists of the following:
1. A radio button group that allows the user to filter the data by year.
2. A chart that breaks down the number of students by course. The user can click on the
chart to select a specific course at any time.
3. A data grid displaying detailed student data for a specific course. The grid becomes
visible only after the user chooses a course. Show the number of students' figures in bold if they are below average. Also, use alternating background colors for the rows.

Requirements
- Implement this feature using React(preferably with Redux).
- Fetch the mock data by creating a Node.js or Python endpoint
- The implementation should work for all major browser platforms
- Implement responsive design and scale for both desktop and mobile browsers

Optional
- Allow the user to edit the grid
- The charts should refresh automatically as the data is committed
- Demonstrate how to incorporate unit testing

General guidelines
- Write clean, properly abstracted code, and pay attention to data structure and performance.
- If you think a requirement is ambiguous, fill in the blanks and document your assumptions.
- Describe possible optimizations that could have been done.
- Host the application to your choice of provider( Heroku, AWS, Azure, etc).
- Once finished please send us the GitHub repository and the application URL.
